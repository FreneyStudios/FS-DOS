Freney Studios Disk Operating System

The original code author

# Project Past 
The project started in 2023 summer,
called *Entelev*, but it didn't made
the final cut as Freney Studios Project
the OS market is full of rivals. The code
of Entelev is lost but it was an edited 
version of *Queso-Fuego* amazing work,
Entelev supported mouse, windows system,
blur design and a "start" menu. Now we
decided to re-create a DOS (So an OS without
window manager, gfx bloats) just to run 
.BIN files
